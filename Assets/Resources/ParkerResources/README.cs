        Parkers Pocket
        Version 1.0
        Dec 7

        For my pocket:
            Movable Objects, Equppable Objects, Player, and Switches/Buttons
            need repective layers as follows:

                MovableObjects at Layer => 8
                EquippableObjects at Layer => 9
                Player at Layer => 10
                Switches/Buttons at Layer => 11

            This can be created and assigned ( I can do this later ) or
            these values can be changed in the 'ParkerPickupBehaviour" script

        I haven't yet checked if the current equip system works with online multiplayer

        CONTROLS:
            'WASD' to Move
            Left Click to Interact ( Pick up and Move Objects)
            'E' to equip or unequip equippable objects (Hightlighted in green)

}
